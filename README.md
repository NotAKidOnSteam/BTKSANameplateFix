# BTKSANameplateMod
BTK Standalone: Nameplate Mod is a small mod for VRChat that changes a few parts of the nameplate!

The main features of this mod are:
 - Return Trust Level colour to nameplates
 - Hide nameplates on friends only
 - Toggle nameplate visibility on a per user basis (In QuickMenu user details)
 - Enable custom nameplates (Not really ready yet)

Most features of BTKSANameplateMod are disabled by default, to make use of these features I recommend you install [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods).

Here's a brief overview of the settings you'll find:
 - Enable Custom Nameplates : Enables custom nameplate colours setup on avatars, this feature isn't ready yet.
 - Hide Friends Nameplates : Hides nameplates on friends
 - Show Trust Colour : Sets the background on the nameplate to match the trust colours (Works with OGTrustRanks!)

## Disclamer
**Warning:** The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!
