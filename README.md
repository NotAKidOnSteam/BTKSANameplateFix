# BTKSANameplateMod For ChilloutVR
BTK Standalone: Nameplate Mod is a small mod for ChilloutVR that changes a bit of how the nameplate works!

This mod requires [BTKUILib](https://github.com/BTK-Development/BTKUILib) or it will not work at all.

The main features of this mod are:
 - Hide nameplates on friends only
 - Toggle nameplate visibility on a per user basis (In QuickMenu user select)
 - Nameplate distance based scaling
 - Configurable close range fade, this replaces CVRs built in fade out with one that can be configured

If you encounter issues with this mod, feel free to contact me on Discord (DDAkebono#0001)!

## Install/Usage
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) version 0.5.7 or higher, this is required as the mod has been updated specifically for 0.5.7!

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/ddakebono/BTKSANameplateFix/releases) and place in your ChilloutVR/Mods folder!
