# BTKSANameplateFix
BTK Standalone: Nameplate Fix is a small mod for VRChat that removes the RNG added to nameplates in a past update.
This allows you to see custom nameplates properly, without the original nameplate being offset from the custom one.

If you're looking for a Custom Nameplate package, you can use [Mochie's Nameplates](https://www.patreon.com/posts/no-longer-works-36966815) as this mod fixes what's broke.

This mod also has a small added feature that you can enable which will enable disabled Custom Nameplates, check the Hidden Custom Nameplate section below for details.
This means that without this mod the nameplate will be hidden, but if a user has the mod it will appear.

The custom nameplate enable feature is disabled by default, but can be configured ingame using [UIExpanionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods)'s config menu.

If you encounter issues with this mod, feel free to contact me on Discord (DDAkebono#0001)!

## Install/Usage
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) version 0.2.0 or higher, the mod should work fine with anything 0.2.x.

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/ddakebono/BTKSANameplateFix/releases) and place in your VRChat\Mods folder.

The mod will initially only be fixing the nameplate position, but you can enable the hidden custom nameplate feature in the UIExpanionKit settings menu.

## Hidden Custom Nameplate
To use this feature you must set the custom nameplate prefab to disabled like shown below, it must also be named the same.

Note that this is only LOCAL, so if you set it up on your avatar others using the mod will be able to see it.

## Disclamer
**Warning:** The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!
