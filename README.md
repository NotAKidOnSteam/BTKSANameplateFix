# BTKSANameplateFix
BTK Standalone: Nameplate Fix is a small mod for VRChat that removes the RNG added to nameplates in a past update.
This allows you to see custom nameplates properly, without the original nameplate being offset from the custom one.

This mod also has a small added feature that you can enable which will enable disabled Custom Nameplates, this requires the user with the nameplate to have the GameObject for it disabled in their hierarchy to work.
This means that without this mod the nameplate will be hidden, but if a user has the mod it will appear.

The custom nameplate enable feature is disabled by default, but can be configured ingame using [UIExpanionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods)'s config menu.
