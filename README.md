# BTKSANameplateMod
BTK Standalone: Nameplate Mod is a small mod for VRChat that changes a few parts of the nameplate!

The main features of this mod are:
 - Fix RNG nameplate offset added in a previous VRChat update
 - Allow resizing the nameplate
 - Adds in a dynamic nameplate resizer that will adjust the nameplate as you move closer to a user
 - Hide nameplates on friends only
 - Use hidden custom nameplates (See below for setup and info)

Most features of BTKSANameplateMod are disabled by default, to make use of these features I recommend you install [UIExpansionKit](https://github.com/knah/VRCMods).

Here's a brief overview of the settings you'll find:
 - Enable Hidden Custom Nameplates : Enables the hidden nameplate feature explained below
 - Hide Friends Nameplates : Hides nameplates on friends
 - Nameplate Size Percentage : Percentage for the scale of a nameplate, can go over 100% if you want to
 - Enable Dynamic Nameplate Resizer : Enables the resizer, will adjust a users nameplate according to the percentage and the max distance settings
 - Dynamic Resizer Max Distance : Sents the range that nameplates will be at original scale

## Install/Usage
Install [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) version 0.2.7.x or higher

Download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/ddakebono/BTKSANameplateFix/releases) and place in your VRChat\Mods folder.

Be sure to check out the UIExpansionKit mod config to configure NameplateMod!

## Hidden Custom Nameplate
If you're looking for a Custom Nameplate package, you can use [Mochie's Nameplates](https://www.patreon.com/posts/no-longer-works-36966815) as this mod fixes what's broke.

This mod also has a small added feature that you can enable which will enable disabled Custom Nameplates, check the Hidden Custom Nameplate section below for details.
This means that without this mod the nameplate will be hidden, but if a user has the mod it will appear.

To use this feature you must set the custom nameplate prefab to disabled like shown below, it must also be named the same.

Note that this is only LOCAL, so if you set it up on your avatar others using the mod will be able to see it.

## Disclamer
**Warning:** The VRChat team is not very keen on modding or reverse engineering the game, while the mod does not include anything that would ruin the fun for others, using it may still be a bannable offence.

**USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**, I am not responsible for any bans or any punishments you may get by using this mod!
